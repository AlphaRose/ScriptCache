# 🐍 Python Scripts – scriptscache

## Overview

This folder contains a collection of standalone Python scripts designed to automate common tasks, simplify workflows, and provide reusable utilities. Each script is self-contained, easy to run, and focused on solving a specific problem with minimal setup.

The scripts in this directory range from small command-line tools to system utilities and API-based helpers. They are intended to be practical, readable, and easy to modify.

## 📂 Structure

Each script typically includes:
- Clear function definitions
- Minimal external dependencies
- Console-based input/output
- Inline comments where helpful

> I try to include a README for each to give a bit more clarity 

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** (recommended)
- Dependencies vary by script and are usually listed at the top of the file or in an accompanying README

To install a dependency manually:

```bash
pip install <package-name>
```

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

Most scripts can be run directly from the command line:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Some scripts may:

- Prompt for user input (e.g., URLs, file paths)

- Require administrative privileges (for system-level tasks)

- Rely on internet connectivity (for API-based utilities)

Refer to each script’s comments or README for specific instructions.

## ⚠️ Notes ⚠️ 
- Scripts are provided as-is and should be reviewed before use, especially those that modify system settings.
- Windows-specific scripts may not function on macOS or Linux.
- Administrative privileges may be required for certain scripts.

## 📜 License
Unless otherwise stated, scripts in this folder are intended for personal and educational use.
