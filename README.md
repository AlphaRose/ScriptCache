# 📄 Script Cache

A curated collection of small, practical scripts I actually use.

No demos. No fluff.
Just utilities that solve real problems.

------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚙️ WHAT THIS IS

scriptcache is my personal script library — a growing cache of helpers,
tools, and one-off scripts that make systems easier to work with.

These scripts are:
- small and focused
- designed to be read and modified
- built to save time, not show off

If you find something useful here, feel free to steal it.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 WHAT YOU’LL FIND

Depending on the folder, you may find scripts for:

- automation & workflows
- system setup and cleanup
- data wrangling
- developer quality-of-life
- ops / admin tasks
- “I don’t want to do this manually again” problems

Languages may include:
- Python
- Bash / shell
- PowerShell
- whatever gets the job done

------------------------------------------------------------

## 📂 STRUCTURE

scriptcache/
- python/
- shell/
- powershell/
- ops/
- utils/
- misc/

Each script should be runnable, readable, and self-contained.

If a script needs special setup, it will say so at the top.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 PHILOSOPHY

- boring > clever
- readable > short
- useful > perfect

These scripts exist to work, not to impress.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧑‍💻 USAGE

There’s no install process.

Clone the repo, copy what you need, adapt it to your environment,
and move on with your day.

git clone https://github.com/AlphaRose/scriptcache.git

------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚠️ STABILITY & GUARANTEES

- Scripts are provided as-is
- Some are rough around the edges
- Expect things to change over time

If you spot a bug or have an improvement, open an issue or PR.
